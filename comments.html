				<p class="grid_12">When it comes to carpet cleaning, tile cleaning, carpet repairs, and area rug cleaning, Orlando Carpet Cleaning Services is the only company that I trust. In past years I've used other companies and had carpet that barely looked cleaned after they were finished, another company scuffed up my baseboards badly, but Orlando Carpet Cleaning Services has been the only company that I could rely on for all of my cleaning needs. Thank you for being such an honest, reliable, respectable company!</p>

				<p class="grid_12">Orlando Carpet Cleaning Services was hired by my wife. We have a dog and he ripped a big hole in our carpet. Orlando Carpet Cleaning Services sent their master technicians out to my house to perform the repair. They patched in a new piece of carpet, and I honestly can't even tell where the patch is! They blended it in so good! I am very happy with the work that was performed.</p>

				<p class="grid_12">I needed the carpet cleaned in my home because I was preparing to sell it. My kids and dog did a number on my carpets over the past 10 years. My carpet was heavily soiled with dirt, dog slobber, mud, juice, soda, you name the stain, I pretty much had it on my carpet! Orlando Carpet Cleaning Services was very thorough and didn't rush through my house like they were needing to get somewhere else. They actually removed all stains! My carpet looks amazing, and my realtor will be thrilled that it's ready to show!</p>

				<p class="grid_12">Orlando Carpet Cleaning Services is a great carpet cleaning company. Orlando Carpet Cleaning is my personal carpet cleaner. They have fit me in last notice for emergency carpet cleanings, and also squeezed me in for an appointment the week of Thanksgiving last year! I love this carpet cleaning company, they do a great job!</p>

				<p class="grid_12">I reviewed Orlando Carpet Cleaning Services website several times over. I looked through all of their coupons and specials, the different levels of carpet cleaning, and what each level of cleaning included. I determined the Advanced carpet cleaning package fit my situation. I just have heavy dirt stains, soda spills, and minor food stains. I chose 3 rooms for the $99 special, which were my bedroom, living room, and stairs. My carpet now looks almost brand new thanks to Orlando carpet cleaning!!! Thank you guys so much for doing a great job!</p>

				<p class="grid_12">Orlando Carpet Cleaning Services impressed me, which is not an easy task. I am a bit of a neat freak, and I get my carpet cleaned every 4 to 5 months. My last carpet cleaner made a huge mistake, by spilling some chemical on my carpet and refusing not to come clean it back up, so I had a discoloration on my carpet. I thoroughly researched carpet cleaning companies, because I obviously needed to find a company that I could trust. I found Orlando Carpet Cleaning Services on Angie's List, and then called them for some very thorough questioning. The representative answered all of my questions with flying colors, and she was very polite. I hired Orlando Carpet Cleaning Services, hoping for the best. There were two guys who came to my home, and they introduced themselves and shook my hand before they even walked through my front door. They were professional from beginning to end, which put me at ease. They removed the discoloration from my carpet, and I had them clean 4 other rooms, plus my staircase. I am very happy with the outcome, and most of all how the technicians handled everything in such a professional matter.</p>
