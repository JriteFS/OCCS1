		<h2 class="grid_12">Carpet Cleaning Tips</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Carpets need to be vacuumed once a week and more often in areas of heavy traffic. Frequent vacuuming prolongs the life of your carpet by preventing a buildup of gritty particles that can cut carpet fibers. Every few weeks, take a little extra time and use your crevice tool for cleaning around baseboards and radiators and in other hard-to-reach places.</li>
				<li>To vacuum wall-to-wall carpeting, divide the floor into quadrants and vacuum an entire quadrant before moving on to the next.</li>
				<li>Take your time when you vacuum a carpet, especially a plush carpet in which dirt is sure to be deeply embedded. One pass with a high-powered upright is not enough. Go over each section of carpeting several times, and work slowly to allow the suction to remove all the ground-in dust and dirt.</li>
				<li>Add baking soda to the bag in your vacuum to fight odors.</li>
				<li>Soil retardants can be applied to new carpets or to newly cleaned carpets. Follow manufacturers' advice. Apply soil retardants only with professional equipment using the recommended application techniques.</li>
				<li>Pay special attention to the areas where people sit and move their feet. Vacuum these areas of heavy traffic with a crisscross pattern of overlapping strokes.</li>
			</ul>
		<h2 class="grid_12">Stone Floor Tips</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>NEVER use vinegar, acid based cleaners or harsh abrasive cleansers.</li>
				<li>Wipe up spills immediately.</li>
				<li>Use leather pieces on the bottom of chairs and stools that are moved frequently. (scrap leather can be purchased at shoe repair stores. Cut to fit and glue on the bottom of chair legs.)</li>
				<li>When cleaning heavily soiled areas, apply cleaning product and let dwell for a few minutes. This allows the agents in the cleaner to do its job, making your job easier.</li>
				<li>Use interior and exterior walk-off mats at all entrances to keep dirt and grit off floor. Don't forget the garage door!</li>
				<li>When grout becomes soiled, flood mop floors with a Floor Clean, then scrub grout and tile with a soft-bristled brush, pick up water with mop.</li>
			</ul>
		<h2 class="grid_12">Hardwood Floor Tips</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>NEVER use vinegar, acid based cleaners or harsh abrasive cleansers.</li>
				<li>When a spill occurs, soak up the liquid right away. Mist the area with cleaner, and wipe with your Bona Micro fiber mop or a Micro fiber Floor Cloth.</li>
				<li>Vacuum, dry mop or sweep to remove any loose dirt or grit. The best method of removing dirt and grit is vacuuming with a soft brush attachment on your vacuum. If using the Bona Micro fiber mop to dry mop, remove any loose dirt or grit after dry-mopping by rinsing with water and wringing out the mop pad prior to cleaning floor with Bona Hardwood Floor Cleaner.</li>
				<li>Using a slightly dampened, well wrung-out Bona Micro fiber cleaning pad, thoroughly clean the floor surface using your Bona Micro fiber mop. Finish one area before moving on to the next. When your mop pad becomes soiled, rinse with water, thoroughly wring out the pad and continue cleaning with Bona Hardwood Floor Cleaner. When the mop pad becomes excessively soiled, launder and replace with another clean mop pad. Continued use of excessively soiled pads may cause streaking.  Your Bona Micro fiber cleaning pads are reusable and washable. Do not use any fabric softeners, dryer sheets or bleach on your Micro fiber cleaning pad as these products will diminish the natural cleaning characteristics of the micro fiber.</li>
				<li>(YOU CAN PURCHASE A WOOD FLOOR MICROFIBER MOP AT HOME DEPOT OR LOWES IN REPLACE OF THE BONA MOP)</li>
			</ul>
		<h2 class="grid_12">Shag Carpet Care and Maintenance Tips</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The best way to care /clean “shag” carpet is to vacuum it with a suction vacuum only. If your vacuum has a beater bar, you should disengage it when vacuuming your “shag” carpet. Using a beater bar or brush may cause the yarns to “feather out” or lose their twist resulting in pilling or fuzzing.</li>
				<li>Proper care maintenance (including vacuuming these products with suction only) will ensure that your “shag carpet” will maintain its unique character for a long time.</li>
